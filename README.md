# ðŸ“Š Logistic Regression for Binary Classification

This project focuses on building a logistic regression model to predict binary outcomes, such as whether a customer will churn or not.

### What we are doing:

- Loading and exploring a dataset with features and a binary target variable.
- Preprocessing the data to make it ready for training.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training a **Logistic Regression** model using `scikit-learn`.
- Interpreting the modelâ€™s coefficients and calculating the **odds ratios**.
- Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, and F1-score
  - **ROC Curve** and **AUC Score**
- Visualizing the ROC curve to assess classification performance.

This project helps in understanding how logistic regression works for binary classification tasks and how to interpret and evaluate the results effectively.
